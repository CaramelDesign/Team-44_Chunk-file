## Introduction
We are building a platform that accepts CSV or JSON large files, and breaks them into smaller bits and still maintains the right format. 

### What is CSV?
A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.
